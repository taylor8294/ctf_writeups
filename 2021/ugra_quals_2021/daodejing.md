This is one of those CTF challenges where if you happen to be familiar with a certain technology, you see it straight away!

The author, *kalan*, did give some clues by mentioning `пути` ("path") in both the title and description of the challenge... but luckily I'm familiar enough with this that the `m`, `c`, `v`, and `h` letters surrounded by numbers was enough for me to spot the key piece of information straight away: the provided file was a series of SVG path commands (the contents of the `d` attribute for an SVG `path` element).

See [d - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d) for an explanation of SVG path commands.

So all that was needed was to turn this into a valid SVG file, as below

```xml
<svg><path d="{contents of daodejing.txt}" /></svg>
```

Viewing the SVG then shows the path data renders to be text characters giving the flag `ugra_grandpa_take_your_pills_or_we_will_beat_up_your_5730a631ec98be6c`.
